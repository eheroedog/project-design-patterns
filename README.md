# Design Patterns
 
 Projects include the following 5 different design Patterns:

 - Strategy
 - Builder
 - Observer
 - Factory method (unconfirmed)
 - Composite (unconfirmed)

### Observer-Squeaker
 
 In this project that takes inspiration from a certain social media platform we apply the observer pattern so the followers of a certain **SqueakerProfile** can be updated when they post new squeaks.

### Strategy-Calculator

 We use the strategy pattern help with the implementation of different operators for our calculator project.

### Builder-RPGCharacterCreator

 When we create new characters we take advantage of the builder pattern to create an object of our desired character.
